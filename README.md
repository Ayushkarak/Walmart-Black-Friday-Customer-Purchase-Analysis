This project dives into customer purchase behavior using Walmart’s Black Friday sales dataset. Through detailed EDA and statistical analysis, we uncover how gender, age, and marital status influence spending — and provide actionable business recommendations.

## 📁 Dataset
- 550,068 transactions
- Columns: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Occupation, City Category, Stay Duration, Product Category, Purchase Amount

- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy (for Confidence Intervals)

## 📊 Analysis Workflow
1. **Problem Definition & Data Cleaning**
   - Converted categorical columns
   - Verified no missing values or duplicates

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots
   - Heatmaps and correlation analysis

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Average purchase by gender and marital status
   - 95% Confidence Intervals for spending patterns
   - Checked statistical significance of differences

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Men** spend significantly more per transaction than women (₹9437 vs ₹8734)
- **26–35 age group** makes the most purchases, while **51–55** spends the most
